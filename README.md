- Modify or delete a dish
- See a list of your chosen dishes in the cart and checkout to order your food

## Technology
- Built an API following RESTful design principles
- Created a server using Express
- Created custom error handlers
- Used express middleware functions
- Used express router to create different routes
- Used CORS to allow access to create CRUD requests

## Discoveries
Learned how to create a server and an API. Also learned how to create routes on the back-end and combine it 
with a front-end starter to create a complete app.

## Future Goals
Deploy both the project and the front-end starter to make a complete working app that anyone can use
